**Student Result Data Analysis**

This project involves a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of student performance data, focusing on various demographic and behavioral factors that may influence academic outcomes.

**Dataset**

The dataset (student_scores.csv) includes details about students such as:

Gender

Parent's Education

Parent's Marital Status

Weekly Study Hours

Number of Siblings

Ethnic Group

Transportation Means

Scores in Math, Reading, and Writing


**Libraries Used**

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn


**Key Insights**

Gender Distribution: More females than males in the dataset.

Parent's Education: Positively influences student performance.

Parent's Marital Status: Has negligible impact on student scores.

Study Hours: More study hours generally lead to higher scores.

Siblings: Study hours vary with the number of siblings.

Ethnic Group: Distribution shown via pie chart.

Transportation Means: Has minimal effect on performance.

Top Performers: Identified students scoring above 90 in all subjects.

Lunch Type vs Parental Education: Visualized with a countplot.


**Visualizations**

The analysis includes several visualizations:

Count plots

Heatmaps

Line plots

Box plots

Pie chart

Violin plots


These help to better understand relationships between features and student performance.
